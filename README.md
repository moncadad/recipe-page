## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned to better utilize reusable code when it came to css. Repeated patterns were given class names that follow BEM rules. This project served as a reminder of how to use table elements, as well as lists. Overall it was a very straight forward build. However, I did come across some challenges trying to replicate the design when it came to list style decoration.

### Continued development

Giving some attention to list styling would be something I plan on looking more into for the future.

### Useful resources

- [List Styling ](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_bullet_color.asp) - This helped me styling the bullet points on list
- [Table Styling](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20872200/giving-a-border-to-an-html-table-row-tr) - This is helped me figure out the stlying for the table element.
